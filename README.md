It can't get better then this, your pull request will be really appreciated by the community. You can get started by picking up any open issues from [here](https://github.com/yogdaan/Supernova-2/issues) and make a pull request.

> If you are new to open-source, make sure to check read more about it [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source) and learn more about creating a pull request [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).

### Community

Supernova is project under Yogdaan.org, and it's community is involved in the development. To get in touch with the community, you can use the following communications channels.

**Gitter**: [https://gitter.im/yogdaan/Lobby](https://gitter.im/yogdaan/Lobby) <br>
**Github**: [https://github.com/yogdaan](https://github.com/yogdaan)

### Workflow

Supernova uses the agile methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast. It follow somewhat modified Git Flow branching methodology.

1. **`Master`** is the equivalent to the git-flow `develop` branch. It should be fully ready to be shipped and should be stable.

2. **`Production`** is the equivalent to the git-flow `master` branch. It represents the latest stable version of Supernova available.

3. **`FEATURE/NAME`** is where we work on the new features and other parts of meilix.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to `master` or any other feature branch only. *`PR to production won't be accepted`*
2. Your code must meet all the best practices and guidelines, other wise it won't be accepted.
3. It must pass all CI tests.

After this, you changes will be **Squash and Merge** in `master` with a conventional commit message.

**Production Deployment**

1. Create a PR from `master` to `production`.
2. Wait for CI tests to pass.
3. **Merge** the PR.

**Why 'Squash and Merge' against `Master`?**

All commits from the PR will be added as a single new commit to `master`.

- It keeps the `master` clean: only commits that represent a complete feature of bugfix will be part of the history.
- Adding `#PR_Number` to the commit message allows to check that PR and dive into all the commit history without bringing all the noise into master.

**Why 'Merge' against `production`?**

- It doesn't create a new commit with a different hash, thus it keeps `master` and `production` with the same commit history.
- It allows to check exactly what was deployed and when.

Learn more about it [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2016/03/15/squash-a-whole-new-way-to-merge-pull-requests/)


### Best Practice

**Commits**

- Make sure your commit message is crisp and clear, read more about it [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- When refering to a issue in PR, use [special words](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) to automatically close the related issue.
- Keep each PR very short, which will make it easy to review.

**General**

- **Comments** <br>
    Comments are what's make the communication possible between programmers and developers, they we created for a single main reason, to make the code readable.
    <br><br>
    We need to comment our logic, reason and flow for making a algoritham/function in a app. we don't have to comment everything, but everything we is based out of our logic.

- **Documentation** <br>
    Documentations are the gates between code base and programmer/humans, they are decrease the time of understanding the code base and make the development process fast.
    <br><br>
    Documentation grow, as our code grow, continous addition is a must for documentation to stay relevent.

**SCSS and CSS**

- **Use hyphen(-) Delimiter**<Br>
It makes sheet more readable.

```scss
    //This is wrong
    .blackCar{}
    //This is best
    .black-car{}
```

- **BEM Scheme** <br>
**B**ody **E**lement **M**odifier(BEM) gives sense to the names, which is globally accepted. let's say we have a paper-car class, here car is body, it's parts are element and any change in its part is modifier. Following should be the best way to name it in **Style Sheet**.

```scss
    //This is how we name the body
    .paper-car{}

    //This is how we name the elements
    .paper-car_seat{}
    .paper-car_glass{}

    //This is how we name the modifier
    .paper-car_seat--blue{}
    .paper-car_seat--black{}
```

- **Style Sheet with Script File** <br>
Using different class and id name for Style Sheet and Script file is best, it avoids the conflict between them and gives better flow. Using "js-" as a prefix for naming the object is prefered, also avoid using keywords for naming objets, like using 'data' for a naming a object will create a conflict, since it is also used by javascript and JSON.

```html
    <div class="paper-car js-paper-car"></div>
```
